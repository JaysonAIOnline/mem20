# RM-240 — Asset Intake, Cataloging and Validation Pipeline

**Outcome:** Normalize, inspect, convert, license-check, deduplicate, and route incoming assets automatically

**Breakthrough:** Every asset becomes engine-ready or is rejected before polluting the project

This package is the machine-executable local implementation derived from the supplied Off Record Lab roadmap. It includes versioned typed state, SQLite WAL persistence, event history/snapshots, SDK CRUD/subscription, resumable idempotent jobs, cancellation, retries/timeouts/quotas/backpressure, deterministic replica reconciliation, local/hybrid/cloud placement/failover, roadmap-specific `qa` logic, decision confidence/explanations, feedback, CLI, HTTP console/API, safety guards, simulator, benchmark/metrics, and rollback-capable installer.

Named live product surfaces, real provider/device credentials, production traffic, and governed FreeStack deployment remain target-environment integration and are not claimed complete.
