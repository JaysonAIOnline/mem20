# RM-137 — Spatial Experience Designer

**Owner:** Jammee  
**Lane:** Creative production, media, brand, and experience design

## Outcome
Compose immersive rooms, exhibits, stores, and game spaces from reusable primitives

## Breakthrough
3D experiences become accessible to ordinary product teams

This package implements the locally executable/non-human portion of this Off Record Lab roadmap on a shared, zero-dependency runtime substrate. It includes typed/versioned roadmap validation, SQLite WAL state + event history, resumable/idempotent jobs, cancellation/timeouts/quotas, deterministic recovery, adaptive mode decisions with confidence/alternatives/bottlenecks/explanations, feedback tuning, CLI + typed client + HTTP API + browser command surface + event stream, local/hybrid/cloud peer execution, conflict-safe LWW synchronization, caching, backpressure/failover, metrics, simulator scenarios, benchmark tooling, safety gating, and a rollback manifest.

The domain engine for this package is keyed specifically to RM-137 and produces deterministic executable results for the roadmap's core operation using only local standard-library code. External hardware, proprietary models, production credentials, live third-party services, and deployment authorization are intentionally not fabricated; those remain environment-bound integration points.

## Run
```bash
python run.py inspect
python run.py run '{"text":"demo","cache":false}'
python run.py simulate
python run.py benchmark --runs 5
python run.py serve --port 8765
```
